# A Gentle Introduction to Parallel Processing in R<br>
Danielle Ferraro <br>
R-Ladies Santa Barbara Meetup<br>
May 26, 2021<br>

This repository contains the sample code used during the RLadies-SB workshop. If you'd like to code along, please install the following packages if you don't already have them installed:

For parallel processing:<br>
>install.packages("foreach")<br>
>install.packages("doParallel")<br>
>install.packages("furrr")<br>
>install.packages("future.apply")<br>

For data wrangling and code timing:<br>
>install.packages("dplyr")<br>
>install.packages("tictoc")

Then, clone or download the repository to your local computer. **sample_code/sample_code_blank.Rmd** is a blank RMarkdown I will code in live during the workshop. Alternatively, **sample_code/sample_code.Rmd** is already filled out for your reference.
